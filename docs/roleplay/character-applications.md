# Character Applications

Character applications are used to determine whether someone's character is able to progress to roles with higher responsibility. These roles can be bending masters, sub-bending users, government roles and more. The reason we have character applications is to ensure that the players advancing to important and high levels roles will be mature and responsible, and will not abuse their position. Applications help us to determine the person's capabilities and experience when considering their opportunity at getting these roles. Applications can be posted in our Character Applications section on our <a href="https://www.rokucraft.com/forum/m/24336306/viewforum/9706889" target="_blank">forums</a>. 

!!! note
    You do not need an accepted character application in order to roleplay! These are only required if you want to progress to higher roles.

    <h3><h3>There will be 3 roleplay scenarios below. Add on to them in character!</h3></h3>

    Your character's at a tavern, sitting at the bar counter when a person drunkenly taps you on the shoulder and challenges you to a bending duel. You can tell that the person is completely discombobulated. What do you do?
    You’re sitting at the bar counter in a tavern. You’re patted on the back with a rugged and calloused hand. You turn around, seeing a tall and muscular man swaying on his feet. He’s dressed in tattered clothes, loose enough to drag along the floor as he walks. “Oi, fight mee!” He hiccups and shuffles into a position with some semblance to a fighting stance.

    You’re cornered in an alleyway by a group of what seems like criminals. There aren’t any ways out of the alleyway besides getting past the group. What do you do? (Think of your combat style, will you be merciful or harsh, etc.)
    You’re walking down the street and turn into an alleyway. Immediately once you step between the suffocating buildings, six figures drop down, three in front of you and three behind you. They brandish daggers. One of them speak up in a demanding voice. “Give us all your jewelry and money you have on you right now, and you won’t be hurt.”

    You’re walking around in a town, going about your business when you hear and see someone standing in the middle of the street pacing and muttering, “Wait, is it this way? No but the map…” What do you do?
    As you stride down the sidewalk, a person bumps into you. You turn to them and see that they’re holding a map. “Ah! Sorry, I’m a bit lost.” They sheepishly look back down at their map and back up so you’re free to continue walking.
